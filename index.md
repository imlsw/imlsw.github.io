For all of the above, this is the place to be. Welcome.

My name is Ilse Löbker. I’m a 26-year-old designer from The Netherlands. This is the only place, except for LinkedIn <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ilselobker" target="blank">&#8599;</a>, where you’ll find something about me, because I deleted my social media accounts back in 2018.

Long story short: Most of my days I’m working on web and app designs. I read a lot of non-fiction books. I work out at 6:15 every morning. Most of my meals are vegan. I learn Japanese for fun.

Anyway.

As a designer, it’s common to have a portfolio website. I decided against this. 90% of my work doesn’t see the daylight. It lives on sketch paper, in words, or in spreadsheets. Therefore, this is my personal space. I go here to check on my references, my to-read list, and recipes. Sometimes I write blogs.

Have a look. See what I like. Hopefully, you will find something you like as well.
