# Books I read in 2020
<div class="main-content-blog"><p>I just read <i>Calypso</i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38348476-calypso" target="blank">&#8599;</a> by David Sedaris, a book so funny it made me cry tears of joy. My favorite story was the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/30/stepping-out-3" target="blank">Fitbit story</a>, followed by the story about feeding his tumor to a turtle (don't ask).</p>
