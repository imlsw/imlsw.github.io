## Highlights
The major highlight of 2019 was our move from Groningen to Nijmegen. We moved at the end of May. Starting June 1st, I had a month off to get my hands dirty on the new apartment and to get to know the city a bit. Did you know that Nijmegen is a spacious and green city compared to Groningen? Also, I started a new job, which I enjoy very much.

In 2019, I traveled more than ever. There was a three-day weekend to Prague in February, a one-day trip to Berlin in April, and a weekend at the Veluwe National Park in May. I went on a one-day trip to check out the Japanese community in Düsseldorf during my month off in June, which was followed by a Summer mostly filled with work. In Fall, there was New York in September, where I attended the Awwwards Conference, and a three-day holiday to the country of Georgia in October. Minus all the trips between Nijmegen and Groningen we did this year.

I saw some great artists live in 2019. There was LANY [&#8599;](https://www.tivolivredenburg.nl/agenda/lany-14-02-2019/) in February and John Mayer [&#8599;](https://www.ziggodome.nl/event/1574755451/john-mayer) in October. Then there was Lowlands [&#8599;](https://www.lowlands.nl/) in August. Not only did I get to see Twenty One Pilots, Billie Eilish, and Tame Impala (again), I also got to discover artists like Pond, Joost, Hyukoh, Honne, and PUP.

Oh, and I started learning Japanese. とてもクール。

## Concerning Goals
Every year, I set goals for myself. These are high-end goals, meaning they're hard to achieve but doable. For 2019, I set two goals for myself:

1. Stop reading so much
2. Start investing my money

### Stop reading so much
The first goal should probably be explained. I’m a fast reader. I read about a page per minute, faster if the book is well-written. I used to read physical books but I haven’t looked back since I bought a Kobo e-reader in 2016. I actually sold or gave away most of my books since. That’s how much I love my e-reader.

![An e-reader with a broken screen on a camping bed.](/assets/images/blogs/2019/broken-ereader.jpg)
*I actually had to replace my e-reader in August because I broke it during Lowlands (and yes, I bring my e-reader to festivals).*

When my e-reader journey started in 2016, I read 85 books [&#8599;](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/11243923). 2017 came along and I got my first real job —which lead to me reading less because, well, priorities and such— and I read 53 books [&#8599;](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2017/11243923). Then I got a bit bored after work and started reading in the evenings. And I kept on reading. I set a goal for 100 books in 2018, which I achieved at the end of June. I finished the year with 170 books on my ‘Read’ list [&#8599;](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018/11243923). That’s more than 3 books *per week*. Hence the new goal I set — and why I started a new hobby: learning Japanese.

![A page from a Japanese study book including the student's answers.](/assets/images/blogs/2019/japanese.jpg)
*Progress on my Japanese. This was taken while working my way through book 3 of the [Japanese From Zero](https://www.yesjapan.com/) method.*

This year I did better. I spent quite some time studying the Japanese language (and finished 2.5 books on that, which I didn’t count towards this year’s books). Overall, I read 75 books [&#8599;](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/11243923), which translates to about 1.4 books a week — a number I consider healthy.

### Start investing my money
Then there’s the other goal. In 2017 and 2018, I did a good job working my ass off without spending every single cent that had made it’s way into my bank account. It worked a bit too well. That’s why I set a goal to start investing the money into something other than my savings. Well, that didn’t turn out the way I wanted it to be.

At the end of 2018, we decided to move, and within a reasonable time period as well. If you’ve ever moved houses, you know it’s a costly business. In this case, we also moved cities – 200 kilometers apart. If that doesn’t break the bank, here’s something that will: moving into an apartment that needs work on EVERYTHING.

![An old, almost empty room with bare walls and old floor.](/assets/images/blogs/2019/renovation.jpg)
*The day we moved into our new apartment. This room reflects the state of it: bare walls filled with holes, ugly flooring, and baseboards from the 70s.*

After moving houses and doing all sorts of odd jobs around the house, I dived into the world of investing. And I decided it wasn’t worth my time. The books I’ve read on money were all American and they don’t translate well into the Dutch ways of how to handle money. Of course, I could make some appointments at banks and investment companies to talk about how to handle the money for me. But at the end of the day I just don’t care enough. I’m more than happy with having a bit of emergency savings and some ‘entertainment’ money that I probably won’t spend anyway.

## The Best Of
I love ‘Best Of’ lists. Every year, I think about writing one. I never do, because I have no one to share it with. Well, my imaginary reader, this one I wrote especially for you. My ‘Best Of’ list of all the things I enjoyed in 2019.

### Favorite songs of 2019
Ever since 2015, I've kept a Spotify playlist of all the songs I liked within a particular year. This way, I can see how much my taste in music has (or hasn’t) changed. Compared to last year, there are less country songs in the playlist, while more indie and rock has made it’s way into the list. I don’t have any particular favorite song for 2019, just a list of songs that I enjoyed:

### Albums I listened way too much
Overall, this category goes to Taylor Swift because Lover [&#8599;](https://open.spotify.com/album/1NAmidJlEaVgA3MpcPFYGq?si=CW_sxT2kRemcxEQ3PhCUpw) was my daily driver from August to December. It includes gems like *Cornelia Street*, *I Think He Knows*, and *Cruel Summer*. I love ‘em all.

Also worth mentioning:
* Billie Eilish – WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? [&#8599;](https://open.spotify.com/album/0S0KGZnfBGSIssfF54WSJh?si=d98UhQuBTJykLCBKM8-uuQ)

### Games I adored
On average, I play video games about 3 hours a week. I usually turn on my console of choice during the weekend, usually in the morning. I don’t consider myself a hardcore gamer – I get scared easily and I dislike shooters. I’m more of a *'let me pick the flowers in Skyrim'* kind of person. I appreciate games with good storytelling and nice designs. Therefore, I nominate every game I played this year because I don’t play a lot of games and I liked all of them:

* Assassin’s Creed: Origins [&#8599;](https://youtu.be/P3eWuaIJQkk)
* The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild [&#8599;](https://youtu.be/1rPxiXXxftE)
* Red Dead Redemption II [&#8599;](https://youtu.be/gmA6MrX81z4)
* Stardew Valley [&#8599;](https://youtu.be/ot7uXNQskhs)

In 2020, we’re transforming one of our spare bedrooms into an office, which means I’ll have a proper set-up to finally play the macOS games I’ve been waiting to play, including The Witness, Civilization VI, and Firewatch.

### Books I recommend reading
I read 75 books this year but there’s only one I would recommend reading to everyone: Michael Pollan’s *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* [&#8599;](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3109.The_Omnivore_s_Dilemma). It’s a book about food consumption, a must-read for anyone who wants an answer to questions such as *"What’s ethical to eat?*. Pollan does a great job investigating the (American) food industry while questioning his own food choices. Even though the book was first published in 2006, the topic is still relevant today.

Because they were well-written, funny, interesting or inspiring, I also recommend reading:

* Michelle Obama – Becoming [&#8599;](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746485-becoming)
* Melinda Gates – The Moment of Lift [&#8599;](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40776644-the-moment-of-lift)

## What Will Happen in 2020
2020 is still a blank page. Some events have been planned, including the *Vierdaagse* and a workweek abroad. City trips are being discussed as we speak. There's also a road trip to Slovenia coming up.

![Picture from the mountains and a lake in northern Italy, taken from a car.](/assets/images/blogs/2019/roadtrip.jpg)
*The Italian Alps, photo taken from the car. From our roadtrip to Naples in October 2017.*

Concerning shows, I've already planned two concerts and two festivals. On June 20, there’s Werchter Boutique [&#8599;](https://www.werchterboutique.be/nl/) with Taylor Swift in Belgium, which I consider a backyard show because it includes Taylor Swift within driving distance. Then, a few days later, there’s Rammstein in the Goffertpark, a 10-minute bicycle ride from our apartment. Down The Rabbit Hole [&#8599;](https://downtherabbithole.nl) has some great names this year, including HAIM and Kacey Musgraves. And there's been talk of another year at Lowlands. We’ll see.

Happy new year and happy new decade, folks. Let’s hope it’s a good one.
