<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<p>The major highlight of 2019 was our move from Groningen to Nijmegen. We moved at the end of May. Starting June 1st, I had a month off to get my hands dirty on the new apartment and to get to know the city a bit. One of the first things I noticed is that Nijmegen is a spacious and green city compared to Groningen. I also started a new job, which I enjoy very much.</p>

<p>This year, I traveled more than ever. There was a three-day weekend to Prague in February, a one-day trip to Berlin in April, and a weekend at the Veluwe National Park in May. I went on a one-day trip to check out the Japanese community in Düsseldorf during my month off in June, which was followed by a Summer mostly filled with work. In Fall, there was new-york/) in September to attend the Awwwards Conference and a three-day holiday to Georgia (the country, not the state) in October. Minus all the trips between Nijmegen and Groningen we did this year.</p>

<p>I saw some great artist live in 2019, even though the number of concerts I’ve been to was low. There was LANY <a href="https://www.tivolivredenburg.nl/agenda/lany-14-02-2019/">↗</a> in February and John Mayer <a href="https://www.ziggodome.nl/event/1574755451/john-mayer">↗</a> in October. Luckily, Lowlands <a href="https://www.lowlands.nl/">↗</a> in August filled all of the blanks. Not only did I get to see Twenty One Pilots, Billie Eilish, and Tame Impala (again), I also got to discover artists like Pond, Joost, Hyukoh, Honne, and PUP.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blogs/2019/lowlands.jpg" alt="View from hill just outside the Lowlands Alpha stage, looking down on the crowd at the festival during sunset." /></p>

<!--The crowd during an Alpha stage concert at Lowlands 2019, my fifth time attending the festival.-->

<p>Oh, and I started learning Japanese. とてもクール。</p>

<h2 id="concerning-goals">Concerning Goals</h2>
<p>Every year, I set a few goals for myself. It’s a high-end goal, meaning it’s hard but doable. For 2019, I set two goals for myself:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stop reading so much</li>
  <li>Start investing my money</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="stop-reading-so-much">Stop reading so much</h3>
<p>The first goal should probably be explained. I’m a fast reader. And by that, I mean that I read about a page per minute, faster if the book is well-written. I used to read physical books but I haven’t looked back since I bought a Kobo e-reader in 2016. I actually sold or gave away most of my books since. That’s how much I love my e-reader.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blogs/2019/broken-ereader.jpg" alt="An e-reader with a broken screen on a camping bed." /></p>

<!--I actually had to replace my e-reader in August because I broke it during Lowlands (yes, I bring my e-reader to festivals).-->

<p>When my e-reader journey started in 2016, I read 86 books <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/11243923">↗</a>. 2017 came along and I got my first real job —which lead to me reading less because, well, priorities and such— and I read 53 books <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2017/11243923">↗</a>. Then I got a bit bored after work and started reading in the evenings. And I kept on reading. I set a goal for 100 books in 2018, which I achieved at the end of June. I finished the year with 170 books on my ‘Read’ list <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018/11243923">↗</a>. That’s more than 3 books <em>per week</em>. Hence the new goal I set — and why I started a new hobby: learning Japanese.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blogs/2019/japanese.jpg" alt="A page from a Japanese study book including the student's answers." /></p>

<!--Progress on my Japanese. I'm working my way through book 3 of the [Japanese From Zero](https://www.yesjapan.com/) method.-->

<p>This year I did better. I spent quite some time studying the Japanese language (and finished 2.5 books on that, which I didn’t count towards this year’s books). Overall, I read 75 books <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/11243923">↗</a>, which translates to about 1.4 books a week — a number I consider healthy.</p>

<h3 id="start-investing-my-money">Start investing my money</h3>
<p>Then there’s the other goal. In 2017 and 2018, I did a good job working my ass off without spending every single dime that made it’s way into my bank account. It worked a bit too well. That’s why I set a goal for myself to start investing the money into something other than my bank account. Well, that didn’t turn out the way I wanted it to be.</p>

<p>At the end of 2018, we decided to move, and within a reasonable time period as well. If you’ve ever moved houses, you know it’s a costly business. Well, in this case, we also moved cities – 200 kilometers apart. If that doesn’t break the bank, here’s something that will: moving into an apartment that needs work on EVERYTHING.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blogs/2019/renovation.jpg" alt="An old, almost empty room with bare walls and old floor." />
<!--The day we moved into our new apartment. This room reflects the state of the whole apartment: bare walls filled with holes, ugly floors, and baseboards from the 70s.--></p>

<p>After moving houses and doing all sorts of odd jobs around the house, I spent somme time looking into investing money. And I decided it wasn’t worth my time. The books I’ve read on money were all American and they don’t translate well into the Dutch ways of how to handle money. Of course, I could make some appointments at banks and investment companies to talk about how to handle the money for me. But at the end of the day I just don’t care enough. I’m more than happy with having a bit of emergency savings and some ‘entertainment’ money that I probably won’t spend anyway.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-of">The Best Of</h2>
<p>I love ‘Best Of’ lists. And every year, I’m thinking about writing one but I never do, because I have no one to share it with. Well, my imaginary reader, this one I wrote especially for you. My ‘Best Of’ list of all the things I enjoyed in 2019.</p>

<h3 id="favorite-songs-of-2019">Favorite songs of 2019</h3>
<p>Ever since 2015, I keep a Spotify playlist of all the songs I like within a particular year. This way, I can see how much my taste in music has (or hasn’t) changed. Compared to last year, there are less country songs in the playlist, while more indie and rock has made it’s way into the list. I don’t have any particular favorite song for 2019, just a list of songs that I enjoyed listening to this year:</p>

<h3 id="albums-i-listened-way-too-much">Albums I listened way too much</h3>
<p>Overall, this category goes to Taylor Swift because Lover <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1NAmidJlEaVgA3MpcPFYGq?si=CW_sxT2kRemcxEQ3PhCUpw">↗</a> was my daily driver from August to December. It includes gems like <em>Cornelia Street</em>, <em>I Think He Knows</em>, and <em>Cruel Summer</em>. I love ‘em all.</p>

<p>Also worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Billie Eilish – WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0S0KGZnfBGSIssfF54WSJh?si=d98UhQuBTJykLCBKM8-uuQ">↗</a></li>

<h3 id="games-i-adored">Games I adored</h3>
<p>On average, I play video games about 3 hours a week. I usually turn my console of choice on during the weekend, usually in the morning. I don’t consider myself a hardcore gamer – I get scared easily and I dislike shooters. I’m more of a <em>‘let me pick the flowers in Skyrim’</em> kind of person. I appreciate games with a good story and nice designs. Therefore, I nominate every game I played this year because I don’t play a lot of games and I liked all of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assassin’s Creed: Origins <a href="https://youtu.be/P3eWuaIJQkk">↗</a></li>
  <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild <a href="https://youtu.be/1rPxiXXxftE">↗</a></li>
  <li>Red Dead Redemption II <a href="https://youtu.be/gmA6MrX81z4">↗</a></li>
  <li>Stardew Valley <a href="https://youtu.be/ot7uXNQskhs">↗</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In 2020, we’re transforming one of our spare bedrooms into an office, which means I’ll have a proper set-up to finally play the macOS games I’ve been waiting to play, including The Witness, Civilization VI, and Firewatch.</p>

<h3 id="books-i-recommend-reading">Books I recommend reading</h3>
<p>I read 75 books this year but there’s only one I would recommend reading to everyone: Michael Pollan’s <em>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</em> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3109.The_Omnivore_s_Dilemma">↗</a>. It’s a book about food consumption, a must-read for anyone who’s asking the <em>“What’s ethical to eat?</em> or similar questions. Pollan does a great job investigating the (American) food industry while questioning his own food choices. Even though the book was first published in 2006, the topic is still relevant today.</p>

<p>Also recommended, because they were well-written, funny, interesting or inspiring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Michelle Obama – Becoming <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746485-becoming">↗</a></li>
  <li>Melinda Gates – The Moment of Lift <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40776644-the-moment-of-lift">↗</a></li>

  <li>Chuck Klosterman – Raised in Captivity <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42585299-raised-in-captivity">↗</a></li>
  <li>Richard  Powers – The Overstory <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180098-the-overstory">↗</a></li>

  <li>Paul Theroux – Deep South: Four Seasons on Back Roads <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23719344-deep-south">↗</a></li>
  <li>Ben Smith – Doggerland <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42363317-doggerland">↗</a></li>

</ul>

<p>If you want to know which books I read this year, visit my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/11243923">Year in Books</a> on Goodreads, the platform I use to track the books I’ve been reading.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-happen-in-2020">What Will Happen in 2020</h2>
<p>2020 is still a blank page. Some events have been planned, including the <em>Vierdaagse</em> and a workweek abroad. City trips are being discussed as we speak. There’s also a road trip to Slovenia coming up.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blogs/2019/roadtrip.jpg" alt="Picture from the mountains and a lake in northern Italy, taken from a car." />
<!--The Italian Alps, photo taken from the car. From our roadtrip to Naples in October 2017.--></p>

<p>Concerning shows, I already planned one concert and one festival. On June 20, there’s Werchter Boutique <a href="https://www.werchterboutique.be/nl/">↗</a> with Taylor Swift in Belgium, which I consider a backyard show because it includes Taylor Swift within driving distance. Then, a few days later, there’s Rammstein in the Goffertpark, a 10-minute bicycle ride from our apartment. Down The Rabbit Hole <a href="https://downtherabbithole.nl">↗</a> has some great names this year, including HAIM and Kacey Musgraves. And there’s been talk of another year at Lowlands. We’ll see.</p>

<p>Happy new year and happy new decade, folks. Let’s hope it’s a good one.</p>
