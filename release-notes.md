# Release notes
## Friday May 1, 2020
Yay! Welcome to V1.0 of my new website. I am still figuring stuff out. This is the first of many improvements to my website.

- Switched from plain HTML to Jekyll [&#8599;](https://jekyllrb.com)
- Switched from TransIP hosting [&#8599;](https://www.transip.nl) to GitHub Pages [&#8599;](https://pages.github.com)
- Rewrote the content on [Home](https://ilselobker.com/)
- Added a blog overview called [Posts](https://ilselobker.com/archive)
- Rewrote [*A Year In Review*](https://ilselobker.com/2019-year-in-review) in markdown
- Added a [404 page](https://ilselobker.com/whoops)
- Added these release notes

### Behind the scenes
- Concerning project management, I am now keeping track of my tasks in Jira [&#8599;](https://www.atlassian.com/nl/software/jira)
- I will start writing drafts in Jekyll [&#8599;](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) instead of Google Drive [&#8599;](https://www.google.com/intl/nl_ALL/drive/)
